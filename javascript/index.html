      <h1>What is an event in JavaScript?</h1>
      <p>
        Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which
        the system tells you about so your code can react to them. For example,
        if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to
        that action by displaying an information box.
        <br />
        onclick- The user clicks an HTML element <br />
        onmouseover- The user moves the mouse over an HTML element<br />
        onmouseout- The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element<br />
        onkeydown- The user pushes a keyboard key<br />
